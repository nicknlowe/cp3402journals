## Estimated Hours
I have spent around 6 hours on this subject this week, with most of that time looking into the customisation and hosting of a CMS website.

## Content Insights
For this second week, I was able to distinguish the difference between static and dynamic websites and how CMS plays a crucial role in transforming a website to respond to user input and data without human intervention. I also learned the different methods of hosting a CMS website as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the dominant providers, Joomla and Wordpress.

A static website delivers fixed content to users and typically requires manual updates to modify information. In contrast, a dynamic website uses a CMS and database integration to generate content in real time, allowing pages to automatically update based on user interaction and collected data. Platforms like Joomla and WordPress are the two biggest content management systems providers by marketshare due to the way they make this approach simple by providing templates, plugins and a main dashboard to let users manage their site content in a convenient manner.

If only a static approach was used, updating larger websites would be time-consuming and inefficient, particularly for organisations that frequently change their web content. However, whilst a CMS-based approach may make websites more adaptable and better suited for the organisation, it does increase the website's complexity and requires server know-how and software correctly configured in order to work as intended.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Once I was able to setup my Joomla website, I began playing around with templates and extensions to gain a better understanding of the tools available and how they influence the difficulty of constructing the website and adding functionality. By customising these layouts and testing different plugins, I believe that I was able to gather skills and knowledge that could serve as potentially useful in my employability as a software/web design developer.
