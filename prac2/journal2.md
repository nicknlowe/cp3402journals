## Estimated Hours
I have spent around 6 hours on this subject this week, with most of that time looking into the customisation and hosting of a CMS website.

## Content Insights
For this second week, I was able to distinguish the difference between static and dynamic websites and how CMS plays a crucial role in transforming a website to respond to user input and data without human intervention. I also learned the different methods of hosting a CMS website as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the dominant providers, Joomla and Wordpress.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Once I was able to setup my Joomla website, I began playing around with templates and extensions to gain a better understanding of the tools available and how they influence the difficulty of constructing the website and adding functionality. By customising these layouts and testing different plugins, I believe that I was able to gather skills and knowledge that could serve as potentially useful in my employability as a software/web design developer.
