## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I re-entered the world of basic website creation and building with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also studied the fundamental aspects of web design and development through LinkedIn Learning and was introduced into the subject and expectations through the lecture videos.

## Estimated Hours
I spent around 4 hours of my time on this subject this week, including time reading and understanding assignment 1.

## Content Insights
For this first week, I was able to re-confirm the use cases for all three languages, with HTML being used for site content, CSS being used for styling the created HTML content and JavaScript being used to create site interactivity and functionality. I was also able to brush up on further information that has also been previously taught, including the use of github and good practices like the imperative mood commit messages convention.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I wanted to see how far CSS could be pushed beyond the scope of basic styling that I had known, which led me to discover and read through Mozilla's CSS documentation and their guide on animations. Thanks to the included examples, I was able to develop a better understanding of more advanced CSS concepts such as transitions and keyframes that had not been really introduced to me in previous subjects like CP1406. Along with being potentially useful in creating more fleshed out websites in the future, this experience also showcased how much further I still had to go within both IT and web design and development and that an exploration approach could continue to be beneficial to me going forward in this subject.
