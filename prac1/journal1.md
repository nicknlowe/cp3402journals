## Learning Activities & Resources
This week I re-entered the world of basic website creation and building with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also studied the fundamental aspects of web design and development through LinkedIn Learning and was introduced into the subject and expectations through the lecture videos.

## Estimated Hours
I spent around 4 hours of my time on this subject this week, including time reading and understanding assignment 1.

## Content Insights
For this first week, I was able to re-confirm the use cases for all three languages, with HTML being used for site content, CSS being used for styling the created HTML content and JavaScript being used to create site interactivity and functionality. By combining all three, I was able to see how each language plays a distinct role in the development of a website.

HTML provides the structure and foundation of a webpage, ensuring that the requested content is displayed as expected. CSS is then applied to control the presentation and visual appearance of that structure, improving the overall readability and user experience. JavaScript can then be applied to add functionality and dyanmic behaviour, allowing users to interact with page elements rather than having to always view static content.

If only HTML were used, the website would just appear plain and lack web design aspects like background colour and text alignment and is also the case if the CSS is applied without the proper HTML structure and etiquette, leading to an underwhelming website user experience for most regular users.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I wanted to see how far CSS could be pushed beyond the scope of basic styling that I had known, which led me to discover and read through Mozilla's CSS documentation and their guide on animations. Thanks to the included examples, I was able to develop a better understanding of more advanced CSS concepts such as transitions and keyframes that had not been really introduced to me in previous subjects like CP1406. Along with being potentially useful in creating more fleshed out websites in the future, this experience also showcased how much further I still had to go within both IT and web design and development and that an exploration approach could continue to be beneficial to me going forward in this subject.
