## Estimated Hours
I spent around 6 hours on this subject this week.

## Content Insights
For this third week, I learnt how to successfully create and customise a WordPress website by following a structured WordPress workflow, consisting of creating the WordPress site, building a child theme and then building the website. Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of how professional WordPress development is structured and why each stage is necessary to ensure a successful deployment.

Creating a WordPress site through a hosting provider involved registering a domain and hosting plan, installing WordPress using a one-click installation process and configuring the site through the dashboard. Whilst WordPress can be setup in a local development environment, this represented the easiest and most effective method to get started customising. Once initialised, key settings as well as themes and extensions could be found, configured and installed to further enhance the WordPress development process. Building a child theme then allowed for safe and structured customisation. By creating a separate child theme that inherits from the parent theme, it demonstrated to me how modifications could be made to styles and template files without directly editing the original theme, reducing the chance of accidental permanent damage to the design. Building the site required applying layout structure for all devices and creating pages to which menus could be organised from. This step focused on designing with the needs of usability in mind, highlighting the need to also ensure practicality than just simply focusing on appearance. This stage also recommends the use of advanced tools such as version control with Git and testing the website prior to production release.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
During the practical, round robin style interviews were conducted by every member to gather an idea of what others believed were good attributes for group members and thus who would be a good fit for their group. All three interviewees began by stating that they were all interested in achieving the highest possible result of High Distinction, followed by the expectation that everyone worked well together and contributed to the project. Additionally, most interviewees specified that they would like a group member to carry some experience in working as team, strongly suggesting that collaboration skills like shared responsibility and conflict resolution are seen as an advantage. By simulating this scenario like a job interview, this activity directly correlated with future employability, with the attribute findings most likely sharing a similar resemblance to that of an employer.
